# HR and Production Management System Front-End

## Project Overview

### The "Optimizing Inventory & HR Management Efficiency" project targets Lucky Lanka PLC, a prominent dairy product manufacturer in Kaburupitiya, Mathara, employing around 200 workers. Currently, manual handling of tasks like employee management and warehouse operations leads to inefficiencies and errors. To address this, our project proposes an online web application using JAVA Spring Boot and Angular Frameworks. This solution aims to automate key inventory and HR processes, including attendance recording, Employee leave management, commission allocation, and damage assessment, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and productivity.
